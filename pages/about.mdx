# About

Low Spec Lab is an idea. The entire purpose for starting this project was to achieve as much feature parity with old or underpowered hardware as you could with modern, more expensive stuff. This may lead us down some... interesting paths. But that's the fun of it! Hope you enjoy reading through the guides that we have painstakingly put together for your viewing.
